# Rules

- Do not use `pip` or `poetry` (this project uses `uv`).

- Do not edit `config.schema.json` (it is generated from Pydantic models).
  If you changed the schema in `config.py`, run `mise generate-schema` to regenerate it.

- After making changes, run `mise pyright`. If it passes, also run `mise check:ai`.

## Useful info

- You can run `mise ok --help` to see all CLI options.
  Every config option has a corresponding CLI option.

## Fixing errors

- `must be called from async context` actually means **trio** context.
  `trio.run()` is the entry point for async code and might be missing.

- Do not use `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorator, it will fail with
  "An asyncio.Future, a coroutine, or an awaitable is required".
