# Rules

- Update the changelog in your plan, if the task results in a change to the codebase.
- Do not use `pip` or `poetry` (this project uses `uv`).
- Do not edit `config.schema.json` (it is generated from Pydantic models).
- After making changes, run `mise pyright`. If it passes, also run `mise check`.
